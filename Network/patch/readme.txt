If you obtain an error about gprc_node.node while trying to launch ./startFabric.sh,

please copy and paste grpc_node.node in PRP-ChaincodeHF/PRS/node_modules/fabric_client/node_modules/grpc/src/node/extension_binary/node-v57-linux-x64-glibc

(after you issued the npm install command with your CLI in PRS, else, the node_modules folder wouldn't exist)
